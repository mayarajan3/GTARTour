The first floor of The Hive houses the PCB Fabrication Station where you can make your own printed circuit boards. PCBs are the heart of modern electronic appliances, connecting all your components in a thin, compact board. Instead of assembling complex circuits manually, you can now fabricate them here. Bring your designs to life for free using the sophisticated PCB laser etcher, plotter and electroplater housed here. If you have no clue on where to start, fret not! Our Hive instructors provide a three-step training process to guide you on your PCB fabrication journey. By the end of your training, you'll be able to confidently build PCBs of up to two-layers.
