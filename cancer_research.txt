	While the Georgia Institute of Technology's College of Sciences is home to countless research programs - the cancer research being done is one of the better known programs. Georgia Tech's has been a leader in the development of collaborative approaches to both cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. The Integrated Cancer Research Center (ICRC) is located in the Parker H. Petit Institute for BioEngineering and Bioscience. New high-throughput methods to molecularly characterize cancer cells have, in recent years, lead to tremendous strides in the development of novel diagnostics and the identification of new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. On the computational side, recently developed algorithms customized for the analysis of genomic, proteomic and other high volume datasets are providing a level of insight into cellular complexities never before imagined. The number of new technologies and devices arising from the fields of biomedical engineering and nanotechnology that have potential application to the area of cancer biology is unprecedented.The ICRC is at a truly exciting crossroads in the history of cancer research where molecular biology, the computational sciences, engineering and nanotechnology are joining together in a unified effort to develop more effective cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.Â
